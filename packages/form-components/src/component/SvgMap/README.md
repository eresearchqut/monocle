# SVG Maps

The SVG Map component renders a clickable SVG in either Single or Multi select mode. To add a new SVG

1. Place the SVG into the svgs folder.
2. To mark an element as selectable add an aria-label and aria-details attribute. 
3. To mark a group of elements as selectable, surround it in a g element that has an aria-label and aria-details attribute
4. Add stories for the MultiSelectSvgMap, SingleSelectSvgMap and SvgMap components 

Rules

1. Do not remove SVG from the folder once they have been released
2. Do not rename the aria-label element once the map has been released
